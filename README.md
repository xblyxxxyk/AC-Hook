[+] Add Aimbot Smoothing


[+] Fix Some players not being rendered on ESP


[+] Improve loops performance


[+] Code is written mixedcase. You can change it to camel/pascal if that is a problem.

[+] Player struct returns some invalid values. IsBadReadPtr is used to get around this, however it would be advised to fix the struct manually.
